1 = optimal conditions for farm
6 = bad conditions for farm

---------------------------------------- SUGGESTIONS ---

use .corrsen, x = 4, y = 4, reduces the dimensions, each pixel 
then covers a larger area on the entire dataset

.rio.resolution

bilinear resampling, look into ways to resample, 

.rio.reproject.match ?? something , resampling =
